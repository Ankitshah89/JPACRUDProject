 ## OVERVIEW

 This project is a Full-Stack Spring MVC application using the C.R.U.D implementation.
 The project allows the user to search the database based on country Id and country name.
 Each country can be searched, modified, or deleted. The user can also create a new country from scratch.

 I am an Econ graduate, so I have always had interest in the global economy and policy and the economics and social developmental factors. With this project, I am trying to implement a database like WorldBanks's, but to a very smaller degree.

 The application development process was divided into two halves. The first was creating the back-end. I first created the database and forward engineered it to have the required entities in Java. I did a J-unit test before moving on to the second stage. The second stage consisted of creating an implementation class
 and a controller which connects my project with the database and the front-end. The front-end was the last part of the project, which included some html, css and bootstrap.

 ### Technologies Used

 * Java Persistence API (JPA)
 * MySql
 * Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL)
 * Java, bootstrap, Html, css


 ## Lessons Learned

 The project was fun and challenging at the same time. Having to develop a full stack application was
 a challenge, but a fruitful one. I had some issues with relatioanl mapping. But after some digging deep, I was able to figure it out. Learning the front-end was fun.
